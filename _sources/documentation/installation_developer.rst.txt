Setting up a Development Environment on Linux or Mac
====================================================

Prerequisites:  make and change to a working directory to contain the new source code
and build. Then download the bootstrap script::

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dials/dials/master/installer/bootstrap.py

or if wget is not available::

  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dials/dials/master/installer/bootstrap.py > bootstrap.py

Then::

  python bootstrap.py

Explanation:  Several steps are performed: update, base, build.  If desired, they can be run individually at the command line::

  python bootstrap.py update
  python bootstrap.py base
  python bootstrap.py build

* "update" checks out or updates source code to the 'modules' directory
* "base" downloads and installs python and third party python packages to the 'conda_base' directory
* "build" configures and compiles dials and cctbx

For subsequent login sessions, be sure to set the environment in order to use the command-line dispatchers::

  source dials

Downloading the DIALS regression test data
==========================================

The DIALS regression test data, needed for some of the DIALS tests, will be downloaded automatically when needed
via the `dials-data package <https://pypi.org/project/dials-data/>`_.
See the `dials-data instructions <https://dials-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
for more information.

There is also a private dials_regression repository that is still used for some historic tests.
For those with svn access to the CCI server, this can be obtained as
follows, replacing "USERNAME" for your username::

  cd modules
  svn checkout svn+ssh://USERNAME@cci.lbl.gov/dials_regression/trunk dials_regression

You do not need to configure the dials_regression module to run dials or dxtbx tests.

Keeping a Development Environment current
=========================================

While you can always create a new development environment from scratch using the instructions above,
it may be much preferable to update an existing environment.
For that you may find the `guide for updating a development environment <https://github.com/dials/dials/wiki/Updating-a-development-environment>`_ in the DIALS Github repository wiki handy.
