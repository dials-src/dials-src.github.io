DIALS 2.0: from images to MTZ files with DIALS
==============================================

On behalf of the DIALS development group, we are pleased to announce the release of
DIALS 2.0.
This provides a complete toolkit for processing of X-ray diffraction data from area
detectors to scaled intensities - free to all users and every line of code available for
inspection at https://github.com/dials/dials.

Thanks to the efforts of everyone in the team we are pleased to announce the release of
DIALS 2.0 for processing of crystallographic rotation data. This includes a large number
of changes in particular:

- symmetry determination and scaling - used by default in xia2
- flexible workflows for challenging data
- speed improvements across the code base to address more challenging data sets
- more consistent output file naming
- multi-crystal analysis with dials.cosym and xia2.multiplex
- Python 3 compatible code (this is currently experimental, but will be fully supported
  in the next major release)

As always we are constantly working on bug fixes and improvements so already we are at
2.0.1. The binaries for download can be found at https://dials.github.io/installation.html.

Tutorials and documentation is available at https://dials.github.io.

If you have any problems please feel free to log issues at
https://github.com/dials/dials/issues or by emailing dials-support@lists.sourceforge.net.
